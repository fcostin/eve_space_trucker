Not an entity such as any you can conceive of, nor I; an entity more primordial than the elements themselves, yet constantly coming into existence even as it is destroyed.  It is the Child of Chaos, the Pathway to the Next.

The darkness shall swallow the land, and in its wake there will follow a storm, as the appetite of nothing expands over the world.

From the formless voids gaping maw, there springs an entity.</i>

The Helios is Creodron's answer to the Ishukone Buzzard. After the fall of Crielere, the once-cordial relations between the Gallente Federation and the Caldari state deteriorated rapidly and, for a while, it seemed as if war might be brewing. It was seen by certain high-ranking officers within the Gallente navy as being of vital importance to be able to match the Caldari's cloaking technology in an effort to maintain the balance of power.

Role: Support Cruiser

Built with special tracking support arrays, the Scimitar was designed in large part to assist heavy combat vessels in tracking fast-moving targets.  Relatively nimble for a support cruiser, it can often be found ducking between battleships, protecting its own back while lending the behemoths the support they need to take out their enemies.

Developer: Core Complexions, Inc.

Core Complexions ships are unusual in that they favor electronics and defense over the "Lots of guns" approach traditionally favored by the Minmatar.  Being a support cruiser, the Scimitar therefore fits ideally into their design scheme.

Following in the time-honored Caldari spaceship design tradition, the Basilisk sports top-of-the-line on-board computer systems specially designed to facilitate shield transporting arrays, while sacrificing some of the structural strength commonly found in vessels of its class.

Developer: Lai Dai

Lai Dai have always favored a balanced approach to their mix of on-board systems, leading to a line-up of versatile ships but providing very little in terms of tactical specialization.  With the Basilisk, their aim was to continue pushing forward the development of cutting-edge defense optimization systems while providing powerful support capability.

The Guardian is the first vessel to feature Carthum Conglomerate's brand new capacitor flow maximization system, allowing for greater amounts of energy to be stored in the capacitor as well as providing increased facilities for transporting that energy to other ships.

Developer: Carthum Conglomerate

While featuring Carthum's trademark armor and hull strength, the Guardian, being a support ship, has limited room for armaments.  Its intended main function is to serve as an all-round support vessel, providing the raw energy for fleet compatriots to do what they need to do in order to achieve victory.

No cruiser currently in existence can match the superiority of the Cerberus's onboard missile system.  With a well-trained pilot jacked in, this fanged horror is capable of unleashing a hail of missiles to send even the most seasoned armor tankers running for cover.

Developer:  Lai Dai

Moving away from their traditionally balanced all-round designs, Lai Dai have created a very specialized - and dangerous - missile boat in the Cerberus.  Many have speculated that due to recent friction between Caldari megacorporations, LD may be looking to beef up their own police force with these missile-spewing monstrosities.

Heavy interdictors are the only ships able to use the warp disruption field generator, a module which creates a warp disruption field that moves with the origin ship wherever it goes.  

Developer: Kaalakiota 

As befits one of the largest weapons manufacturers in the known world, Kaalakiotas ships are very combat focused. Favoring the traditional Caldari combat strategy, they are designed around a substantial number of weapons systems, especially missile launchers. However, they have rather weak armor and structure, relying more on shields for protection.

Developer: Thukker Mix

Improving on the original Stabber design, Thukker Mix created the Vagabond as a cruiser-sized skirmish vessel equally suited to defending mobile installations and executing lightning strikes at their enemies.  Honoring their tradition of building the fastest vessels to ply the spacelanes, they count the Vagabond as one of their crowning achievements.

As a vanguard vessel, its thick armor and dazzling destructive power make it capable of cutting through enemy fleets with striking ease.  Zealots are currently being mass-produced by Viziam for the Amarr Navy.

Developer: Viziam 

For their first production-ready starship design, Viziam opted to focus on their core proficiencies - heavy armor and highly optimized weaponry. The result is an extremely focused design that, when used correctly, can go toe-to-toe with any contemporary cruiser design.

Touted as "the Ishkur's big brother," the Ishtar design is the furthest CreoDron have ever gone towards creating a completely dedicated drone carrier.  At various stages in its development process plans were made to strengthen the vessel in other areas, but ultimately the CreoDron engineers' fascination with pushing the drone carrier envelope overrode all other concerns.

Caldari Frigate Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Cruise Missile damage and -16.66% reduction in Explosion Radius of Cruise Missiles per level

Covert Ops Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Cruise Missile and bomb kinetic damage and multiplies the cloaked velocity by 125% per level

Role Bonus: -99% reduction in Cruise Launcher powergrid needs, -99% reduction in Bomb Launcher CPU use and -100% targeting delay after decloaking

"12034";"834";"Hound";"Name: Hound
Hull: Breacher Class
Role: Stealth Bomber

Specifically engineered to fire cruise missiles, stealth bombers represent the next generation in covert ops craft. Advanced techniques in spatial distortion technology enable them to potentially fly faster when cloaked than when uncloaked - a fact which, coupled with their considerable firepower, makes them extremely dangerous in the hands of an accomplished pilot.

In addition, stealth bombers' extremely advanced missile navigation subroutines are able to triangulate a cruise missile's trajectory in advance, resulting in a decreased factor of signature radius and making the missile more effective against smaller targets.

Developer: Boundless Creation

Boundless Creation ships are based on the Brutor tribe's philosophy of warfare: simply fit as much firepower onto your ship as humanly possible. On the other hand, defense systems and "cheap tricks" like electronic warfare have never been a high priority.

Minmatar Frigate Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Cruise Missile damage and -16.66% reduction in Explosion Radius of Cruise Missiles per level

Developer: Viziam

Viziam ships are quite possibly the most durable ships money can buy. Their armor is second to none and that, combined with superior shields, makes them hard nuts to crack. Of course this does mean they are rather slow and possess somewhat more limited weapons and electronics options.

Amarr Frigate Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Cruise Missile damage and -16.66% reduction in Explosion Radius of Cruise Missiles per level

Covert Ops Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Cruise Missile and bomb EM damage and and multiplies the cloaked velocity by 125% per level

"12042";"324";"Ishkur";"Name:  Ishkur
Hull:  Incursus Class
Role:  Assault Ship

Specialized as a frigate-class drone carrier, the Ishkur carries less in the way of firepower than most other Gallente gunboats.  With a fully stocked complement of drones and a skilled pilot, however, no one should make the mistake of thinking this vessel easy prey.

Developer:  CreoDron

As the largest drone developer and manufacturer in space, CreoDron has a vested interest in drone carriers.  While sacrificing relatively little in the way of defensive capability, the Ishkur can chew its way through surprisingly strong opponents - provided, of course, that the pilot uses top-of-the-line CreoDron drones. 

Gallente Frigate Skill Bonus: 5% bonus to Small Hybrid Turret damage

Hull: Incursus Class
Role: Assault Ship

The single-fanged Enyo sports good firepower capability, a missile hardpoint and some extremely strong armor plating, making it one of the best support frigates out there.  Ideal for use as point ships to draw enemy fire from more vulnerable friendlies.

Developer:  Roden Shipyards

Unlike most Gallente ship manufacturers, Roden Shipyards tend to favor missiles over drones and their ships generaly possess stronger armor.  Their electronics capacity, however, tends to be weaker than ships from their competitors.

Deep space transports are designed with the depths of lawless space in mind.  Possessing defensive capabilities far in excess of standard industrial ships, they provide great protection for whatever cargo is being transported in their massive holds.  They are, however, some of the slowest ships to be found floating through space.

The reel has been universally panned by critics for what is perceived by many as intensely lurid subject matter.  One scene that's caused an uproar among various fundamentalist factions involves two of the main characters, Amarr girl Nadira and Brutor male Okar, engaging in a bout of severely salty reparte immediately followed by quite obviously-hinted-at sexual activity.  In another, the Gallente protagonist, a comely young female, enjoys a sultry dance with two other girls, culminating in a show of half-naked flesh that sent mothers everywhere lunging for their children's eyes.  Mentions and displays of Quafe Ultra during the reel's 89-minute running time number around 110, resulting in an average of 1.23 not-so-hidden advertisements per minute of the film's running time - another reason, critics say, to throw this reel into the jettison canister where it belongs.

Role: Interdictor

Interdictors are destroyer-sized vessels built to fill a single important tactical niche: the breaching of enemy warp tunnels.  Capable of launching warp-disrupting interdiction spheres, interdictors are of great value in locations of strategic importance where enemy movement must be restricted.  Additionally, much like their destroyer-class progenitors, they are well-suited to offensive strikes against frigate-sized craft.

"22852";"659";"Hel";"Inspired by a vicious scissor-toothed shark indigenous to old-world Matar, the Hel is widely viewed as a sign of a Republic out for blood.  Since the beginning of its development it has remained a project cloaked in secrecy, with precious few people aware of its progress and its capabilities, and its formal unveiling has come as a defiant slap in the face to many who formerly believed the Matari incapable of working at this scale of starship design.  

Whatever comprises the soil of its roots, though, one thing is clear: from no-frills living quarters to grim, unadorned aesthetic, this ferocious behemoth has been designed for one purpose and one purpose only.

Imagine a dozen deadly hornets pouring from the devils mouth.  Now imagine they have autocannons.

Brothers, we must rise.

"23890";"526";"Inter-Galactic Media Report - The Audesder Incident (1 of 3)";"Minmatar pioneers recently discovered an ancient Nefantar holy site within Audesder which was thought to have been lost forever during the Rebellion.  It is the burial place of the long-dead Nefantar prophet, Tyrion Plethar, the first Minmatar priest of the Amarrian religion, as well as hundreds of other priests and saints.  It so happens that this holy site is located inside a giant space ship, still intact despite many years of neglect, and incredibly the crew was found still alive, albeit in a cryogenic state.  <br><br>  Originally this holy site was located in Hjoramold XII which now resides in Minmatar Republic space.  During the great Rebellion, the Nefantar government on the planet had given up all hope of defending their solar system against the massive rebel forces headed their way.  The neighboring constellations had already fallen and it was only a matter of time before their own fell into the hands of their enemies.  So they decided upon a drastic plan to save the holiest site located within Nefantar space, the burial place of Tyrion Plethar.  <br><br>  The plan was to transfer as much of the holy site, buildings and all, into a giant space ship, renamed to the Pletharian', which would in turn fly towards the Amarr Empire, where it would most assuredly be kept safe.  The ship had originally been built by Amarrian engineers to be a mobile outpost of sorts, but was the only available vessel that could carry the massive buildings which were part of the burial site.  <br><br>  Loading the burial site onto the ship took a matter of days, although it was quite a hasty procedure and resulted in a number of mishaps, where a number of the buildings were damaged and one even completely destroyed as it toppled from the cranes used to elevate it from the ground.   But eventually the majority of the buildings had been painstakingly transferred into the space ship.  It was then that the rebels attacked, appearing out of nowhere and quickly descended upon the meager Nefantar defenses,.  <br><br>  But even though the defenders were no match for the incoming Minmatar armada, they still bought the Pletharian enough time to set off on its course towards Amarr Space.  The only problem was, it was too massive to use the stargate.  It had been brought to the system in parts and assembled, but in its current state there was no way it could access the stargate out of Hjoramold.   So they had to manually fly it through the vastness of space, without any jump-drive capability.  <br><br>  The destination was Audesder, a solar-system heavily fortified with Amarr forces.  At the time the Nefantar government in Hjormold believed that it was impossible for the rebels to advance far enough to conquer Audesder.  Ironically this system was one of the last to be taken during the later stages of the rebellion.";"2038";"0";"1";"0.10000000000000001";"0";"1";"";"0";"True";"";"0"
"23891";"526";"Inter-Galactic Media Report - The Audesder Incident (2 of 3)";"Little is known of what happened to the Pletharian during its journey, and eventually the remaining Nefantars, now called Ammatars, gave up hope of ever finding it again.  But with its discovery by Minmatar explorers,  the situation has changed dramatically.  The Republic has released little info on their findings to the public, but one thing is clear, something must have caused the Pletharian to malfunction and become stranded in space for all these years.  Possibly a collision with an asteroid, or simply a breakdown of their thruster system.  Whatever the cause, the Pletharian has now become the hottest topic on everyone's lips within the Ammatar / Minmatar border zone.  <br><br>  Needless to say, shortly after the discovery had been confirmed by Republic authorities, the Ammatar government demanded that it be handed over to them.  The Republic refused, citing that it contains the remains of convicted mass-murderers and Amarrian collaborators, and it would be an affront to all those enslaved and tortured during Amarrian rule to hand them over to the Ammatar.  Instead they intend to make it into a museum, to be shown to Republic citizens as a grim reminder of the past.  <br><br>  The Ammatars were far from pleased.  This was the last straw in a chain of political collisions between their people and the Republic.  Their citizens demanded action, and even within the Amarr empire itself there were rumors that the imperial fleet was preparing for war.  After all, Tyrion Plethar was the most highly regarded member of the Amarr faith which was of Minmatar origin.  The Republic's refusal to hand over his remains was not only an affront to the Ammatar nation, but to the Amarrian church as well.  <br><br>  And so the buildup for war has begun.  The Amarr and Ammatars have built a massive military outpost in Kenobanala, which is directly connected to Audesder.  Cruisers and battleships keep arriving daily from all over the empire, and media reports indicate that even Minas Iksan, one of the Empire's most prestigious military generals, who led the successful campaign against the Blood Raiders a few years ago, has arrived.  This does not bode well for the stability of the region, which is already on the brink of a potentially disastrous war.  <br><br>  To top it all off, the Caldari and Khanid, which have recently become official allies of the Amarr Empire and Ammatar, have been caught up in the fray.  They have sent both financial support and military aid to the front lines, boosting up the already massive invasion force.";"2038";"0";"1";"0.10000000000000001";"0";"1";"";"0";"True";"";"0"
"23892";"526";"Inter-Galactic Media Report - The Audesder Incident (3 of 3)";"On the other side of the fence, the Minmatar Republic has been flooding Audesder with its own troops.  Desperate to prevent another Amarr occupation, it has poured all of its resources into creating an impregnable defensive barrier between it and the Ammatar.  The Gallente Federation and ORE have lent their support as well, the Federation sending an armada of ships to help defend Audesder incase of an attack, and ORE supplying the Minmatar forces with financial aid as well as hired mercenaries.  <br><br>  War looms over this troubled area, and analysts suspect that it may spread to outlying regions.  This could even be the start of a new galactic war that no one wants except the most fanatical nationalists.  CONCORD are monitoring the situation closely, and have reportedly been trying their hardest to soothe the political climate to prevent an all-out-war.  But even they cannot prevent the inevitable battle over Audesder, and we can only hope the conflict will not spread to the neighboring regions.

Komni dealt in simple garbage hauling tasks, employing a few dozen washed up pilots to do the sordid task of transporting unrecyclable material to remote locations within the Caldari solarsystems.<br><br>Unfortunately Shojin had been inexcusably spoiled as a child, and lacked all of his fathers virtues which had helped him become so successful.  The Komni corporation quickly began losing money, bad deals were made and the daily affairs were generally ignored by Shojin who spent most of his time dating beautiful women and staying out late at night at popular Caldari bars.  But when his father learned of the state of things, and that the Komni corporation had slid to the verge of bankruptcy, he became furious.  He demanded that his son straighten things out, or all of his shares within the mega-real-estate corporation would go to his other son, Akimo.<br><br>Shojin became terrified at these grim tidings, and was especially worried that his father would also strip him of access to his bank account which he so much relied on to live his extravagant lifestyle.  So he turned to the underworld for aid, secretly contacting an agent employed by the Guristas Pirates, Drako Minai, to manage his corporate affairs.  At first this worked out perfectly, the Komni stock rose considerably and money came streaming in.

"23915";"547";"Chimera";"The Chimeras design is based upon the Kairiola, a vessel holding tremendous historical significance for the Caldari.  Initially a water freighter, the Kairiola was refitted in the days of the Gallente-Caldari war to act as a fighter carrier during the orbital bombardment of Caldari Prime. 

It was most famously flown by the legendary Admiral Yakia Tovil-Toba directly into Gallente Primes atmosphere, where it fragmented and struck several key locations on the planet.  This event, where the good Admiral gave his life, marked the culmination of a weeks concentrated campaign of distraction which enabled the Caldari to evacuate their people from their besieged home planet.  Where the Chimera roams, the Caldari remember.

"23917";"659";"Wyvern";"The Wyvern is based on documents detailing the design of the ancient Raata empires seafaring flagship, the Oryioni-Haru.  According to historical sources the ship was traditionally taken on parade runs between the continent of Tikiona and the Muriyuke archipelago, seat of the Emperor, and represented the pride and joy of what would one day become the Caldari State.  Todays starfaring version gives no ground to its legendary predecessor; with its varied applications in the vast arena of deep space, the Wyvern is likely to stand as a symbol of Caldari greatness for untold years to come.

"23945";"314";"Komni History (2 of 2)";"But soon the old man became suspicious.  He couldn't believe the incredibly good fortune his son was suddenly blessed with was simply due to hard, honest work.  So he hired an expensive private detective, Asamura, to investigate the internal affairs within Komni, to better understand exactly what had changed since disaster loomed over the corporation.  Asamura, being an ex-elite agent within the Caldari State special forces, quickly discovered who was behind this turn of events; that the Guristas had been using the garbage haulers as a means to smuggle drugs and other illegal goods into Caldari high secure space for enormous profits.  Due to Kaimos's close relationship with many members of the Caldari State government, the garbage haulers received far less attention from local security forces than other, more suspcious craft.<br><br>When Kaimo heard of these tidings he became furious. If the news surfaced about Komni being under the influence of the Guristas Pirates and committing illegal acts within the Caldari State borders, his status and even his life might be forfeit.  He immediately confronted his son and ordered him to cut all ties with the Guristas, as well as letting him know that he had just blown any chance he had of acquiring the family fortune.  But there was one single flaw in Kaimos plan, and that was his underestimating of his sons determination to remain wealthy.  Threatening to expose Komnis illegal dealings to the media, Shojin played the only card he had.  Either his father leave his corporation alone and give it a large credit "donation", or both of their reputations would be ruined.  In return Shojin would severe all ties with the Guristas.  His father reluctantly accepted his sons terms.<br><br>Shortly thereafter Shojin held a secret meeting with his contact within the Guristas.  He demanded that Drako stop the illegal activity the Guristas had been conducting behind his back, and remove all ties they had with Komni.  But the wry, finely dressed agent simply laughed, they had played Shojin for a fool all along.  While Shojin had been endulging himself with the finer things in life, Drako had been busily hoarding the company stocks in preparation for a takeover.  He knew about Asamuras involvement, and expected this very conversation.  As Shojin looked in horror, two burly, brown-skinned men entered the room where he stood next to Drako.  With a simple move of his right hand, Drako ordered his guards to execute his unfortunate client.  And as he left the room, followed by high-pitched screams which were quickly silenced, the smiling, middle-aged man dressed in a shiny black tuxedo thought of how happy he was that the Komni stock had risen drastically upon the news of the takeover.  No longer would he need to answer to his less-than-trustworthy superiors within the Guristas, from this day forward he would own his very own branch within the vast Caldari criminal network.

Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the siege module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional power to its defensive and logistical capabilities.

This results in a great increase in the carrier's ability to provide aid to members of its fleet, as well as a greatly increased rate of defensive self-sustenance.  Due to the ionic flux created by the triage module, remote effects like warp scrambling et al. will not affect the ship while in triage mode.

This also means that friendly remote effects will not work while in triage mode either. The flux only disrupts incoming effects, however, meaning the carrier can still provide aid to its cohorts. Sensor strength and targeting capabilities are also significantly boosted. In addition, the lack of power to locomotion systems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp travel are available to the ship, nor is the carrier able to dock until out of triage mode.

Note: A triage module requires Strontium clathrates to run and operate effectively.  Only one triage module can be run at any given time, so fitting more than one has no practical use.

It was originally created for tourist attractions as a quick and easy way to navigate between important sites within a solar-system.
<br><br>
However recently it has become quite popular within military and pirate circles, as a way to limit the risk of losing highly-sensitive coordinates to the enemy.  Instead of handing out bookmarks to every ship in the fleet, there would be a single Pathfinder Gate which would direct the ships from a common meetingplace.  That way keeping the coordinates hidden would be that much simpler, as well as preventing hackers from uncovering the coordinates by breaking into a computer mainframe of a ship of the fleet.

Additionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can. It also possesses a sizeable drone bay, jump drive capability and the capacity to fit a clone vat bay. This combination of elements makes the Rorqual the ideal nexus to build deep space mining operations around.

Due to its specialization towards industrial operations, its ship maintenance bay is able to accommodate only industrial ships, mining barges and their tech 2 variants

-5% reduction in fuel consumption for industrial cores per level
5% bonus to effectiveness of mining foreman gang links per level when in deployed mode

It wasnt long after the Thukkers began deploying their jump capable freighters that other corporations saw the inherent tactical value of such ships.  After extended negotiations, Ishukone finally closed a deal exchanging undisclosed technical data for the core innovations underpinning the original Thukker Tribes design allowing them to rapidly bring to the market the largest jump capable freighter of them all, the Rhea, a true behemoth of the stars.

Developer : Ishukone

Ishukone, always striving to be ahead of the competition, have proved themselves to be one of the most adept starship designers in the State.  A surprising majority of the Caldari Fleets ships of the line were created by their designers.  Respected and feared by their peers Ishukone remain amongst the very top of the Caldari corporate machine.

There is continuing speculation as to how exactly the Thukkers manage to move their vast caravans throughout space relatively undetected, but their expertise with jump drive technology became glaringly apparent when they created the Nomad.  Now seeing widespread service with roving Thukker outrider detachments, the Nomad is rapidly becoming an essential part of Thukker life away from the great caravans.

Developer : Thukker Mix

Thukkers spend their entire lives forever wandering the infinite in their vast caravans.  As such their technology is based as much upon necessity as their ingenious ability to tinker.  Their ship designs therefore tend to based upon the standard empire templates but extensively modified for the Thukkers unique needs.

As the largest drone developer and manufacturer in space, CreoDron has a vested interest in drone carriers but has recently began to expand their design focus and employ drone techniques on whole other levels which has lead some to question where this leap in technology came from.
